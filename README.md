My background is mainly in Technical Support, which has provided me with strong troubleshooting and problem-solving skills.

Recently however I have wanted a fresh start. This has lead me to begin a 16 week intensive software development bootcamp at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy). Here I hope to hone and make use of the skills I have developed in my previous working experience to grow from an interested amateur coder into a competent and confident junior developer.
